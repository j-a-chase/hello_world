# Overview

This is a simple program that takes a fun spin on printing 'Hello world!' to the console. I just wanted to reinforce a bit of practice, as well as figure out how to print to the console in color.

My software prompts the user to play a guessing game, which loops with a smaller upper bound dependent on the number of guesses made in the previous game until you beat a game with only one guess. Upon beating the game, the user is launched into an endless conversation with the console, which suddenly uses red text and more aggresive messages after 10 user inputs. The only way to abort this conversation is to close the program or reply to the console with 'Goodbye.', which will then cause the program to finish.

I created this software to create a fun intro to my portfolio with a simple program that expands on the basic 'Hello world!' concept.
